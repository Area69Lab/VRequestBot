### Request Bot - Made by Velosh GSIs
* This bot is used to obtain and send requests from a specific group to the private group. (Example of Velosh: There is the public group that is for everyone, and the private group to obtain and accept requests.)

### Why it exists?
* Because the livegram has bad conditions, and in addition to being slow (and easy to down). Bonus: It is useful for large groups like Nippon, Velosh, Rui and others.

### How to setup
* Open "Secrets" tab in repo's settings, and set the vars:
```
REPOBASE: The repo url base for autoloop (Ex: https://github.com/Area69Lab/VRequestBot), fork it before please
TOKEN: TG Bot's Token
MAIN_CHAT: Your public id group (Ex: -1001309580081 from t.me/veloshgsis)
PRIVATE_CHAT: Your private id group for orders or like that
USERNAME: Your github username
PASSWORD: Your github password
```
* Then just run it.
